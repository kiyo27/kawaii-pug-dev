# Kawaii PUG

This project is inspired by the [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), the oldest known NFT art, and named after the [Kawaii SKULL](https://twitter.com/kawaiiskull_nft?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). The CryptoPunks are 24x24 pixel art images, generated algorhythmically, with a total of 10,000 collectible punks exist. Each punks has its own attributes and no two are exactly alike.

The Kawaii PUG is derived from the name of a project by Japanese NFT artists called Kawaii SKULL. "kawaii" is the Japanese word for cute in English, but it has become a known word in the real world. The Kawaii SKULL is one of the most famous NFT projects by Japanese NFT artists, and shows that even they can challenge the world. We have added "kawaii" to the project's name to promote Japanese kawaii culture to the world and to show that this project was created by Japanese creator.
